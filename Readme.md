# ASTR 115 Stellar Structure and Evolution Term Project
## Winter 2026

Basic, 1D, stellar structure and evolution program developed as a class project...

To install the 'sixseven' package to your current python environment in 'editable' mode, run
'pip install -e .'
in your root directory (directory with sixseven, cache, Readme.md, etc.)

This will install the proper dependencies you need for this package and also has author information (see sixseven.egg-info folder)

Once the package is installed, you can import a function from sixseven as so:
'from sixseven.nuclear import nuc_burn as nb'
